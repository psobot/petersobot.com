Lately, I've been spending the majority of my time behind a computer screen. When I say "lately," I instead mean "in all recent memory and for the forseeable future." If I'm not hacking away at work, I'm hacking away at home, trying to create my next big, viral software project by myself. I've found that once you've created something popular, you're hooked. If your creation has gone viral, the addiction only gets worse.

Virality is popularity, in its most instant form. Virality is watching Google Analytics for fun, and reading blog posts and news articles about your creations. Virality gives us, as Andy Warhol so aptly put it, our "fifteen minutes of fame" - only instead of on TV, we're famous on the interwebs, where the audiences are much more localized. Having a viral app is one of the most addicting feelings you can get without having to buy something from someone in a dark alleyway.

On top of the rush of virality, there's the possibility that it will lead to bigger and better things. Each viral app helps you learn more about how to make your next one - and each time your name gets in front of someone else, it boosts your reputation by a miniscule amount. (Or, as you constantly remind yourself, that one person could be very important - this could be your big break!) Each app, each blog post, each YouTube video is really just a paper airplane that you hope will fly higher and longer than the last one did.

As with all addictions, an addition to creating has its downsides. Every day, you think about how you can improve your app, or how you could increase conversions before the next visitor spike hits, or how you could get more and more eyeballs in front of your logo. You stop thinking about concrete goals, and just want *more*. If you have zero revenue, this is all a way of buying a better reputation and, hypothetically, creating value. If you already have revenue, then this is also a way to make a quick buck. If you already have lots of revenue, then congratulations - you've been legitimized - you should now start a company and take things at a reasonable pace.

The addiction becomes all-consuming. You stop thinking about making plans for the weekend, and start thinking about how you can most efficiently improve your app between the time you get home on Friday night and the time you leave for work on Monday morning. You put Google Analytics on your TV at home, because hey - it's a better distraction than a real TV show, right? You watch AdSense daily and get scared when you see a negative slope on any one of its graphs. You gain inertia at a maddening rate. It becomes impossible to stop.

But why? Why do you have to keep creating? Why is it so all-consuming? It costs you time and money, both arguably better spent on enjoying yourself. If it's a race, then you have no way of judging where you stand in the rankings. If it's trying to "out-do the Joneses," as it were, you're essentially on top of your house, re-shingling your roof with insane determination while the Joneses are enjoying themselves on their front lawn. **It's unhealthy, and there's no balance in it.**

This is when you realize that **it's not fun anymore**. Your side project, the little hack you started a couple months ago, that you've spent hundreds (if not thousands) of hours on, has become a chore. The work is no longer fun. It's grown in scope and complexity to the point where **you can't justify investing your own time** to further the product. The point of hobby projects is to learn and have fun. When the hobby project becomes big enough that you plan things in your life around it, it's gone too far.

Some people take these obsessions, find other like-minded people, spend thousands of dollars on energy drinks and web servers and *found a startup*. If your hobby project isn't that big or impressive, though, you're stuck in limbo. You've run out of time, money and drive to bring your project to the next level, but it already has enough intertia that you can't stop there. You leave the servers running, hope that your AdSense revenue will balance out your huge server bill, and **try** to move on.

The word **try** is bolded above because it's not easy to move on in the least. Even though you've shut down your staging servers and removed the project's git repo from your laptop, you constantly catch yourself daydreaming about what it would be like if you could have seen your project through to "completion." (As if there really is a finish line.)

If you're lucky, you learn to relax. You enjoy your life. You don't spend your vacation thinking about things to add to your task list, or techniques that might drive additional user engagement.

If you're not lucky, you move on to your next project, starting all over again. You see your project through the initial high points of design and construction. You stay up for days creating something and enjoying every second of it. You release it. You see the traffic spike. You micro-optimize. You respond to Reddit and HN comments. You hack on a version 2.0. You grow frustrated with hacking on it. The project grows in scope and complexity, and you lay back on your bed at 3am, laptop in hand, and whisper "this isn't fun anymore."

Rinse and repeat until you don't recover from the inevitable quarterly burnout.
