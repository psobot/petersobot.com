[Steganography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography) is the fascinating field of hiding messages "in plain sight," without tipping off a potential third party that a message even exists. In modern times, computers allow steganography to take thousands of cunning forms -  Wikipedia contains [a huge list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography#Digital), including:

> - Concealing messages within the lowest bits of noisy images or sound files.
> - Concealing data within encrypted data or within random data.
> - Injecting imperceptible delays to packets sent over the network from the keyboard.
> - Blog-Steganography. Messages are fractionalized and the (encrypted) pieces are added as comments of orphaned web-logs

These are only some of the suggested options - and there are undoubtedly hundreds more that have been tried over the years.
